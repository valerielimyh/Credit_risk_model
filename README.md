Predicting borrowers' likelihood to default on a loan
==================================================

While the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis has resulted in negative implications, it has also generated growth opportunities for new players in the retail credit field. After the brief credit scarcity, a new internet company has thrived, such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending. 

Fintech P2P lenders have introduced many opportunities, such as improved speed, better customer experience, and reduced costs. However, P2P lending platforms results in higher risks, among which higher credit risk: not owned by the lenders, and systemic risks: due to the high interconnectedness among borrowers generated by the platform. This calls for new and more accurate credit risk models to protect consumers and preserve financial stability. 

To address this issue, I developed a classification model to identify whether a borrower would default on his/her loan by using behavioural features and information available on loan applications (from https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data).
